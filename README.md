## About

Flux is a power tool for interacting with large language models (LLMs) that **generates multiple completions per prompt in a tree structure and lets you explore the best ones in parallel.** 

Flux's tree structure allows you to:

- Get a wider variety of creative responses

- Test out different prompts with the same shared context

- Use inconsistencies to identify where the model is uncertain 

It also provides a robust set of keyboard shortcuts, allows setting the system message and editing GPT messages, autosaves to local storage, uses the OpenAI API directly, and is 100% open source and MIT licensed.
